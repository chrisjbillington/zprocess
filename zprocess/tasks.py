# This module contains a minimalistic task queue. It is used by the zlock and zlog
# servers (zprocess.locking and zprocess.logging respectively) in order to wait for
# requests from clients for a limited amount of time so that other due tasks can be
# performed at set times. This is similar to the kind of functionality provided by
# async/await, but is simpler and more performant. I may make the jump to asyncio in the
# future for this functionality, but this serves the needs of these two servers well for
# the moment.
#
# Usage is to instantiate a TaskQueue, instantiate Task objects, and then call
# TaskQueue.add() to add them to the queue. One can then inspect how long until the next
# task is due with TaskQueue.next().due_in(), and use that number as a timeout for any
# blocking operation to be performed. The next task then then be obtained (and removed
# from the queue) with:
#
# task = TaskQueue.pop()
#
# and run by calling it:
#
# task()
