Plan:

- Client will format log messages and send data to server, with a filepath prepended as
  a separate zmq message.

- Server will be initialised with max size and rollover values. Or whatever. Rollover
  settings are on the server, and are not on a per-file basis.

- There will be a single logging handler clients will use. It will have a HWM and just
  cough a warning if messages don't get through. As with h5_lock,
  labscript_utils.setup_logging will start a server with the desired settings, and leave
  it running.

- Server will close files if it hasn't heard about them in a while (10 seconds?) This
  should not introduce any latency since the client is not blocking.
